## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
cd jarvis-voice-assistant
````

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.13 installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `pyaudio` fails, install with:

```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

### 3. Add your OpenRouter API Key

In `ai_agent.py`, replace this line:

```python
self.api_key = "your_openrouter_api_key"
```

with your actual API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
